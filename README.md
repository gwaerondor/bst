# binary search tree
The one millionth implementation of a binary search tree,
just in case you didn't like the other 999 999 ones.

The limited functionality makes it basically useless and
it's probably a good deal slower than gb_trees anyway!
You shouldn't use this code.
But feel free to use it even though you shouldn't.

## Functionality
It is possible to:
- initialize a tree with a root node containing a key and a value.
- add nodes with key-value pairs to the tree.
- rebalance the tree.
- add a bunch of elements to the tree at the same time.

It isn't possible, yet, to:
- delete a node.

## Build
```rebar3 compile```

## Test
```rebar3 eunit```

## \[X\] doesn't work for me!
